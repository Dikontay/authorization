# Role-Based Authorization in Go

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of role-based authorization in a Go application. It leverages several well-regarded packages to create a secure and efficient authorization system. Below is an overview of the technologies used:

## Web Framework

- **Gin**: A high-performance web framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and microservices. [Gin-Gonic](https://gin-gonic.com)

## Authentication

- **JWT**: Utilizes the Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and scalable user authentication. [go-jwt](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5)

## Validation

- **Validator**: A library for variable and struct validation using tags. It's used here to ensure that request payloads meet our expectations before processing. [Validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/v10)

## ORM

- **GORM**: The ORM of choice for this project, providing a developer-friendly way to interact with PostgreSQL databases. [GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html)

## Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used to store and manage the application data.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, ensure you have Go installed on your machine, along with PostgreSQL. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `go get` inside the project directory.
3. Configure your database connection settings in the application configuration file.
4. Run the application using `go run main.go`.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- User registration and authentication using JWT for secure access control.
- Role-based authorization that restricts access to certain functionalities based on the user's role.
- Data validation using the Validator library to ensure that only valid data is processed.
- Database interactions through GORM for efficient data management and queries.
